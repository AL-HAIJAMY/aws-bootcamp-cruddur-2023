# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## watched all the videos 

## i have created a new environment in Honeycomb named my AWS bootcamp

## i have set my env var ( API KEY ONLY ) along with jessica advise not to set the service name here while later in the docker compose file .

## i named the OTEL service name in the docker compose file  .. -- added the other OTEL elemnts to the file too . 

## added instrument packages to the requirements file 

## cretaed the trace files in app.py and initialized the tracing and initialized the automatic instrumentation to honeycomb in app.py 

## did a compose up and everything is ok so far and added some fixed ports to yml file to avoid every time opening the ports manually 

## added additional step to wiew logs in the backend flask app by creating additional initialized tracer and exporter for console logs 

## i got some results and traces in Honeycomb ( see examples below )

## i went through the trace and checked the attributes mentioned there . i can see the service name , the time stamp , the duration .

## to have some spans we need to accuire a trace then create some spans to visualize them in honeycomb

## after creating the spans i got some more spans in the same trace as shown .

## added some attributes to the spans . ( our custom attributes ) 

## we got the new custom attribute mentioned in the span details (result length)

## use the query services in Honeycomb to visualize our traces

## extend more visualization to specific time

## after adding the spans and attributes we could see more detailed info for our trace . i faced a problem at first trying to get the data to honey comb . with reopening the enviroment again everything was fixed  .


## updated the yml file with npm i to save time when launching gitpod 

## started instrumenting x-ray for flask 

## added the sdk file to requirments file and reinstall again 

## added import libraries to app.py 

## setup resources in xray.json file 

## created xray group using aws cli
