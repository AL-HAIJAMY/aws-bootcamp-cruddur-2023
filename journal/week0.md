## i have installed the AWS CLI 

i installed the CLI going through the instructions . at first i strugled because i thought that i have to use the instructions for windows . then in my second attempt i realized that we are using the GITPOD and its linux environment so we have to use the instructions for linux same as the bootcamp video . 

the gitpod-yml file is updated
